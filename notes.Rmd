# Monday

----

Please install the rmarkdown package.  I forgot to include that.

```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

----

If you do not have LaTeX installed, you can install the tinytex package.  Run these commands.  This will allow you to make PDF files from R Markdown files.  Some of you installed tinytex, but you need to run the 2nd command also to install LiveTeX.

```
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

----

If your get an error saying package or repository unavailable when you are trying to install packages, try the following:

* Make sure you are online.
* Run `chooseCRANmirror()` from the command line.  Pick any mirror.
* Try installing package again.  Repeat with a different mirror if it doesn't work.
